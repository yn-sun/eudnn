code for the paper of "Evolving unsupervised deep neural networks for learning meaningful representations" published by TEVC

B.T.W., only the core code of the algorithm is released here, because the full code is built upon on an library that has been out of date and the not supported officially.


Please cite our this paper if you have used or motivated from this code, thanks very much.
